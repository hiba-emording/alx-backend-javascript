# Typescript

## Task 0

### Overview

This directory contains TypeScript code and configuration for Task 0.
The main objective is to demonstrate basic TypeScript functionality and configuration.

### Files

- `main.ts`: Contains TypeScript code for Task 0.
- `package.json`: Manages project dependencies.
- `tsconfig.json`: TypeScript configuration.
- `webpack.config.js`: Webpack configuration for bundling TypeScript.

### Setup

1. **Install Dependencies**

   Make sure you have Node.js installed. Run the following command to install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Compile TypeScript**

   Compile the TypeScript code into JavaScript using the following command:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

3. **Run Development Server**

   To start the development server and watch for changes in your TypeScript files, use:

   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

   This will start a development server with live reloading enabled. By default, it serves the application at `http://localhost:8080`.
